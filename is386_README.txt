Running:
All programs should be run using python3 on Tux.

To run the LSE cnn program, you will need python3. This was all tested on Tux.
python3 is386_lse.py

To run the MLE cnn program, you will need python3. This was all tested on Tux.
python3 is386_mle.py

To run the LCE cnn program, you will need python3. This was all tested on Tux.
python3 is386_lce.py

To run the multi-kernel cnn program, you will need python3. This was all tested on Tux.
python3 is386_multi.py

To run the yalefaces cnn programs, you will need python3. This was all tested on Tux.
python3 is386_q6_arch1.py
python3 is386_q6_arch2.py

Once you run this, you will be prompted for the number of hidden layers, and then the number of nodes per layer.

All programs are seeded.

Notes:
For my first architecture in question 6, I have very low accuracies. I ran out of time, but could not figure out why
the accuracies were poor. My kernel might have been poor. My objective graph looks fine however.
